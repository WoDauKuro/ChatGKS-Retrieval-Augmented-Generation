Saint G. M. Urhobo, the first President of the GKS, was the instrument or vessel of honour chosen by God through Jesus Christ, according to the election of grace, to accomplish His purpose – Matthew 24:31; Acts 15:14-18; 10:9-35; James 1:18.\\n\\nHistory:\"),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/About the GKS.pdf'}, page_content='History:\\n\\nThe history of the God’s Kingdom Society is linked with the biography of her first President, Brother G. M. Urhobo, in respect of his career as an astute preacher of the gospel. He hailed from the Urhobo ethnic group and was the second son of a kind pagan gentleman, the Late Ukoli of Otovwodo, Agbassa in Warri, who was the grandson of Urhobo. He was educated at the Government School Warri and taught in Roman Catholic School as well as the Government School, Warri, in the 1920s. In June 1930, he joined the Posts and Telegraphs Department as a postal clerk and telegraphist after completing a two-year teacher’s training programme in 1929 in Asaba.'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/About the GKS.pdf'}, page_content='Undoubtedly, his strong inclination for divine knowledge fired his interest in the Holy Bible which he spent most of his time to study. The most significant experience of his life came when he fell into a trance and received the Lord’s commission. It was this remarkable occurrence that brought about the radical change in his life from a civil servant to an adroit preacher of the gospel! There was never a time he equivocated with regard to his spiritual calling; rather, he ever so well made open declarations about the grace the Lord bestowed upon him – and he lived up to it. Here is his own testimony: “After three and half years diligent and prayerful studies of the Holy Bible, Jesus Christ revealed himself to me in a vision and commanded me to go and proclaim the good news of God’s Kingdom (or ‘Gospel of Peace’) to all nations as the only remedy for all human sufferings and woes; to expose all the false doctrines which Satan had used to deceive the people and to keep them in ignorance of God’s Kingdom and purpose of creation; and to pronounce God’s written judgment against all wickedness”. Under the circumstances, it was virtually impossible for him to continue to serve under the Nigerian Colonial Government. He had no other alternative than to obey the Lord’s command, like St. Paul of Bible fame (Acts 26:12-20), and devote his life wholly to Christ’s Ministry as “the Lord’s freeman”. So, in February 1933, he resigned from the Government Service and became a full-time Minister of the gospel of Christ. This was quite in harmony with the biblical injunction, which says: “For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s servant. Ye are bought with a price: be not ye the servants of men” – 1st Corinthians 7:22,23.'),\n",

Urhobo from the civil service for no other reason than that he, being anointed by the Lord, was going to give his whole time to God’s Kingdom service, gave cause for his own relatives and many of his colleagues and friends to view his sanity with suspicion. It was really difficult for the unspiritual to appreciate his decision and course of action in throwing to the winds, “for the love of preaching” as some said such an enviable post in the Government Service in those days when men of his social rank were regarded as the elites of society!'),\n",
